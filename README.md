3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm start`. The server should be running locally on port 3001
5. Navigate to the endpoint you're trying to request in the browser (ie if you want to GET users, navigate to http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users in the browser)
6. Practice making your network requests in the console or a Repl!


## Making the requests

In the console, use the following endpoints to:

- GET all users
- POST a new user (you can verify this worked with another GET request)
- GET all animals
- POST a new animal
